DESC:Having steeped their weapons in the ancient magic of Thassilon, the PCs are finally ready to confront the newly risen Runelord Karzoug at the seat of his power. To do so, they must travel high into the mountains, to the fabled city of Xin-Shalast, where they'll be confronted by enormous giants, dragons, and other monsters before they can finally confront the mad wizard of greed in his mountaintop palace. Yet can defeating Runelord Karzoug stop the rise of the Runelords? Or are there more terrors yet to come?

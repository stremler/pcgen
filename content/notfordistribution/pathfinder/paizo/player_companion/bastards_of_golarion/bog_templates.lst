# ORIGINAL ENTRY: Andrew Wilson (nuance)
# ORIGINAL ENTRY DATE: 12 February 2014

# Note: I have Given the Mordent Spire Half-Elf the Azlanti language.  The
# suggested starting languages for other heritages, I have ignored.  Since
# Half-Elves have LANGBONUS:ALL, and Mordent Spire Half-Elves are the only
# heritage that specifically get different starting languages, it seem the
# lnguages entry for the other heritages is pure fluff and should not replace
# LANGBONUS:ALL It makes even less sense when you consider that Mordent Spire
# Half-Elves all begin play speaking Azlanti so it can't be an available bonus
# for a high INT. ARW 23 Feb 2014

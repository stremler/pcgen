Disfiguring Touch	CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard,Witch=2	SCHOOL:Transmutation									TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Touch		TARGETAREA:Creature touched												DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) days			SAVEINFO:Will negates	SPELLRES:Yes	DESC:With a touch, you cause the victim of this spell to suffer a painful curse that causes it to grow horribly disfigured.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell				SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:With a touch, you cause the victim of this spell to suffer a painful curse that causes it to grow horribly disfigured. The physical appearance of the deformity is subject to the caster's whim, but most demon worshippers choose deformities that reflect their Abyssal patron's shape or form. The victim of the spell can resist the effects with a successful Will save, but if he fails, he takes one of the following penalties: -2 decrease to an ability score [minimum 1]; -2 penalty on attack rolls or saving throws; or Land speed reduced by 5 feet. You may also invent other effects, but they should be no more powerful than those described above. The deformity created by this spell is a curse and cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by any effect capable of removing curses.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell
Rift of Ruin	CLASSES:Cleric,Sorcerer,Wizard=8		SCHOOL:Conjuration	SUBSCHOOL:Calling		DESCRIPTOR:Chaotic|Evil	TYPE:Arcane.Divine	COMPS:V, S		CASTTIME:1 standard action	RANGE:Long		TARGETAREA:5-ft.-wide, 60-ft.-deep extradimensional hole, up to (CASTERLEVEL*5) ft. long [S]	DURATION:(CASTERLEVEL) rounds [see text]	SAVEINFO:Reflex partial	SPELLRES:No		DESC:This spell tears a rift in reality, creating an extradimensional hole with a depth of 60 feet.|!PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell								SOURCEPAGE:p.48	DESC:This spell tears a rift in reality, creating an extra-dimensional hole with a depth of 60 feet. You must create the rift on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since the rift extends into the Abyss, it does not displace the original underlying material or allow access to areas below the surface—you can create the rift on the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any Large or smaller creature standing in the area where you conjure the rift must make a Reflex save to avoid falling into the rift. If the Reflex save is successful, the creature picks which side of the rift it remains on once the rift opens. Unattended objects or structures fully engulfed by the rift automatically fall into it. The walls of the rift are covered by razor-sharp blades, while the rift floor seethes with strange chewing vermin, boiling pools of acid, writhing shards of ice, and all manner of other chaotic and deadly manifestations of the Abyss. A creature that falls into the pit takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the pit (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the pit’s environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the pit rather than at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round, and is randomly selected from acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the pit can make a Reflex save to take half damage that round. The pit’s walls have a Climb DC of 25. When this spell’s duration ends, the rift snaps shut, violently expelling all creatures still within. These creatures take double damage from the rift’s environs in that round and are knocked prone as they are returned to the surface above. At any time during the spell’s duration, you can use it to conjure a number of Abyssal denizens out into the surrounding region as a standard action. Doing so causes the rift to snap shut, ending the spell’s duration and returning any creatures that had fallen into it to the ground as detailed above. As the rift snaps shut, choose one of the following creatures or groups of creatures to appear in the area—these Abyssal denizens are treated as if you had summoned them via summon monster VII, and remain for a number of rounds equal to the remaining duration of the rift of ruin spell. You can choose one of the following to be summoned: 1 bebilith, 1 vrock, 1d3 succubi, 1d3 shadow demons, 1d4+1 babaus, or 1d4+1 brimoraks.|PRERULE:1,DisplayFullSpell

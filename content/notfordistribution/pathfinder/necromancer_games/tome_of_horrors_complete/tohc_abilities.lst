Deformities (Ex)				KEY:Deformities ~ Aberant			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AberantRaceAbility.RaceAbility.Extraordinary.SpecialAttack		SOURCEPAGE:P.12	DESC:Aberrants possess an assortment of terrible deformities unique to each individual creature. When determining the deformities of a typical aberrant, roll randomly or choose 1d4–1 deformities from the Aberrant Deformities table. If two deformities are contradictory, reroll or select another. Racial bonuses gained from different deformities are cumulative. For each deformity an aberrant possesses, it gains a –2 racial penalty on Charisma-based checks with non-aberrants except for Intimidate checks, where it instead gains a +2 racial bonus.

Debilitating Constriction		KEY:Debilitating Constriction ~ Abyssal Harvester	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbyssalHarvesterRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:An abyssal harvester that has successfully grappled an opponent of its size or smaller deals tentacle damage plus 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round the hold is maintained. A creature reduced to Constitution 0 by an abyssal harvester dies. Note, that the abyssal harvester only deals Constitution damage when constricting a foe.
Far Reaching				KEY:Far Reaching ~ Abyssal Harvester			CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbyssalHarvesterRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:An abyssal harvester can remain on its abyssal plane and inject up to four of its tentacles across the dimensions and into the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, material planes, or Nine Hells. It can do this a total of twelve times per day (so it could inject one tentacle twelve times into any plane, or four tentacles up to three times each).  All of its tentacles must be injected into the same plane, and all appear within the same 20-foot area. While using this abitliy, it uses sensory organs on its tentacles to see, hear, smell, and feel its surroundings. It can attack normally (at its full attack bonus) while using this ability but it cannot move from its current location. It can withdraw its tentacles as a move action and re-inject them into the same plane (or a different plane) on its next turn.  A dismissal, dispel chaos, or dispel evil spell (using the second effect of either spell) causes an abyssal harvester to withdraw a single tentacle (whichever one was touched) if it fails its Will save.  It cannot re-inject that same tentacle into the same plane for one day.  A banishment spell forces an abyssal harvester to withdraw all of its tentacles if it fails its Will save. It cannot re-inject any tentacles that were banished into the same plane for one day.
Harvest					KEY:Harvest ~ Abyssal Harvester				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbyssalHarvesterRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Supernatural	SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:This ability can only be used when the abyssal harvester is on its abyssal plane and injects its tentacles into the Ethereal Plane, Astral Plane, a material plane, or the Nine Hells.  A grappled foe with 20 or fewer hit points or 4 or fewer Constitution points must succeed on a DC 21 Will save or be drawn through an invisible planar gate (created around the abyssal harvester’s tentacles) onto the same plane where the abyssal harvester currently resides. An opponent drawn into the same plane with the harvester is still grappled upon arrival. The save DC is Charisma-based.
Tentacle Regeneration			KEY:Tentacle Regeneration ~ Abyssal Harvester		CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:AbyssalHarvesterRaceAbility.RaceAbility.SpecialQuality.Extraordinary	SOURCEPAGE:p.14		DESC:An abyssal harvester regrows any lost tentacles in 1 week.
